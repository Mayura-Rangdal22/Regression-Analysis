# Uber Ride Price Prediction using Regression Analysis

## Introduction
Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, we will use regression analysis to predict the price of an Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location.

## Objective
To predict the price of an Uber ride using linear regression and regularized regression models (Ridge and Lasso). We will evaluate and compare the performance of these models using metrics like R² and RMSE.

## Dataset
The dataset for this task is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset).

## Conclusion
By implementing and comparing different regression models, we can predict the price of an Uber ride with reasonable accuracy. Linear regression provides a baseline model, while Ridge and Lasso regression offer improvements by handling multicollinearity and performing feature selection, respectively. Evaluating these models using metrics like R² and RMSE helps in understanding their performance and choosing the best model for the task.
